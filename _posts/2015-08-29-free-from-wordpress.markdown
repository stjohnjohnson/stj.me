Well, here I am.  Wordpress-less.

I figured after 5+ years of not updating my Wordpress blog, that maybe it's a
little overpowered for what I need.

I was also quite sick of the alerts from Rackspace that I my VM had consumed all
the memory again.  I'm sure there's something bad going on, but honestly I really
didn't want to worry and maintain it anymore.

So welcome to the start of my new site.  Looks the same (mostly), but in fact is
completely flat-file - built entirely with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)!

That means no more databases, server-side code, security updates, etc.  It's
amazing!

Obviously, I'm significantly lacking content - intentional of course.  I was
going through the process of migrating my old blog posts, but it occurred to me
that I don't think 5-7 year old posts about PHP 5 are really applicable anymore.
Hence the blank slate.

Hopefully as I find any free time, I'll be populating this with old projects,
new ideas, and fun things I discover in my daily life.

Out of wordpress, into the fire.
